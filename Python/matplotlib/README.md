# Sample Matplotlib programs
I've provided you with some examples of how MatPlotLib works in Python along with a simple way of parsing a CSV file.

## scatter.py
There is some slightly frightening math in scatter.py. If you understand it, that's cool. If you don't... Well that's fine, the program is already written for you :) If you're really curious, look up linear regression.

## plotter.py
Shows how to plot a line graph and shows how to plot a pie chart. I'd highly recommend looking into the documentation of Matplotlib. It can produce some really cool graphs and charts.
