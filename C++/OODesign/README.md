# Object Oriented Design
Object Oriented Design is an extremely important concept in C++ development (not limited to only C++). I'm going to provide you with some sample applications for you to look over. I'll attempt to leave comments in my code to help explain exactly what I'm doing.

## What is Objected Oriented Design?
Object Oriented Design is the idea of your code being organized into objects. For example, if you were designing some application that dealt with animals, you'd probably have a Dog object, a Cat object, and other types of animals. This way, the Dog object owns the code for Bark, and the Cat object owns the code for Meow. You probably don't want your Cat to Bark and your Dog to Meow (unless you really want to! You're the one desinging the software!).

## C++ and Object Oriented Design
C++ enables OO Design via Classes. These classes hold the information for each Object. There are a variety of Object Oriented constructs, however I'll try to address the most common ones and let you either a) figure out the rest or b) come to me during my office hours.
