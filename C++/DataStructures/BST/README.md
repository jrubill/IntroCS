# Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees are a useful data structure that allows searching of data that has an average search, insert, and delete time complexity of O(logn) and requires O(n) space. In this situation, n refers to the number of elements. So for a tree of 10 elements, the number of elements that has to be traveresed to get to your value is about log<sub>2</sub>(10) which is approximately 3.

## Properties
	The left subtree of a node is less than the node itself.
	The right subtree of a node is greater than the node itself.
	The left and right subtree must also be BSTs.
	No duplicates
