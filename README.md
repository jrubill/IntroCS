# Important Resources for Computer Science

Computer Scientists tend to use a wide variety of tools in their work. Starting off can be a bit intimidating, so we've compiled a list of important resources that you should keep in mind.

## 1. GitHub (i.e. Version Control)

GitHub allows you to store your code online in case something were to happen to your computer. You can keep track of the changes made to a repository, and roll back changes to a previous version. You can collaborate with others and work on a project together. Make sure you check out their [tutorials](https://guides.github.com/).

**Note:** Please refrain from putting your school work on here. Don't put classwork into public repos. This is against the Academic Integrity Policy.

## 2. Student Developer Pack
   
The [Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) you access to free private repositories on GitHub, along with many other pieces of software/free trials. Apply by using your .edu email.

## 3. VirtualBox

[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) enables you to run a Virtual Machine on your computer. This basically means you can run Linux on your computer as if it were a program. If you don't enjoy using SSH, this is an option to develop your code locally on your machine, and then transfer your code onto the school's machines to test them out.

**Note:** Just because your program works on your machine doesn't mean it will work on the school's machines. Please test your code appropriately.

## 4. Text Editors

Text Editors are essential for working on software. Get a text editor that you enjoy using on a regular basis. Common choices are: [Atom](https://atom.io), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Vi/m, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), and Emacs.

## 5. IDE's (Integrated Development Environments)

IDE's provide many extra features to make programming easier. These typically include Version Control, Text-Completion, and a compiler/interpreter built in. There are many different IDE's, so I'd recommend doing your research.
   
**Note:** If you're a CS student, I'd highly recommend you stay away from IDE's at first. This will force you to learn the syntax without relying on text-completion and automatic error checking. This practice WILL help you on your quizzes, exams, and projects.

## 6. Linux
I'd highly recommend choosing a flavor of Linux (i.e. distro) such as Ubuntu or any of its derivatives to work with. These distros are free to download. I've provided a brief(nowhere near exhaustive) list of distros for you to choose from:

+ [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com)
+ [Ubuntu MATE](https://ubuntu-mate.org/)
+ [XUbuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)
+ [LUbuntu](https://lubuntu.net/)
+ [Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
+ [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)

You can either install these on a Virtual Machine, or you can dual boot your computer.

## 7. YouTube
YouTube has loads of free tutorials for programming, Linux, installing software, etc. You don't have to go out and buy a book(unless you really want to) as many topics are covered on YouTube. If you're using any resources online for a school project, make sure that you include that information alongside your assignment. Make sure you contact your professor to get approval of any outside resources.
